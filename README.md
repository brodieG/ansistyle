**THIS PACKAGE IS NO LONGER UNDER DEVELOPMENT**

Ended up needing too much of the functionality built-into `crayon`, so instead figured out that removing depenencies form `crayon` was not too difficult.

## Overview

Stripped down dependency-less version of the [`crayon`][1] package by G치bor Cs치rdi.  Modifies character vectors by adding ANSI escape sequences to render text with style in terminals that support ANSI style escape sequences.

This package allows other packages to implement basic ANSI styles with a minimal dependency footprint.  For most purposes you are probably better off using [`crayon`][1] rather than this package since [`crayon`][1] implements all the functionality available here and quite a bit more.

## Acknowledgements

G치bor Cs치rdi for [`crayon`][1] and for adding a new dimension to the R experience.
